When using hex colors, we most often use the #R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>G<sup>1</sup>G<sup>2</sup>B<sup>1</sup>B<sup>2</sup> format (6 characters). If we use it in the #R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>G<sup>1</sup>G<sup>2</sup>B<sup>1</sup>B<sup>2</sup>A<sup>1</sup>A<sup>2</sup> format, we add the alpha channel. 8 characters. When R<sup>1</sup> = R<sup>2</sup> and G<sup>1</sup> = G<sup>2</sup> and B<sup>1</sup> = B<sup>2</sup>, we can write it in #R<sup>1</sup>G<sup>1</sup>B<sup>1</sup> format (3 characters) (Ex: #5522EE -> 52E). If we want to add the alpha channel to the short version, we can write it as #R<sup>1</sup>G<sup>1</sup>B<sup>1</sup>A<sup>1</sup> for short (4 characters).

The letters (A-F) and numbers (0-9) used in the hex definition can also enable us to obtain meaningful words (ex: BADASS -> #BADA55). Here is a list of these (Turkish) meaningful words, looking at the colors, learning the dictionary meanings of the words. It is a fun project where we can look at alternative writing styles such as RGB and HSL apart from the hex format of the color.

I started using React with CRA in this project. After hearing about Vite, I decided to give it a try and migrated the project to Vite.

## üôè Acknowledgments

Here is the piece of code that I slightly modified and used in this project to separate the text from the background color.
